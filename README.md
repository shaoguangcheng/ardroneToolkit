ardroneToolkit
==============

A toolkit for one helicopter named ardrone

This project is my college graduation project. 

In this project, I try to implement the flight control system for a quadrotor named Ardrone with compute vision methods. 

I build this system based on some exsiting projects for example, Arcuo, heli.
Aruco : http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/26
heli : I am sorry to not find the link

I employ the UI with Qt library and CV algorithms with Opencv

There is a tiny flight video example in our code package with AVI format.
